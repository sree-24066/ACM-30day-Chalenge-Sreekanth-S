## Description

In this cycle, i worked with a mental health & burnout dataset to learn core preprocessing techniques. This includes:
- Handling missing values
- Visualizing distributions
- Detecting & removing outliers
- Understanding correlations

The goal was to clean the dataset for downstream ML tasks.
